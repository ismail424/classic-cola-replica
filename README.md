**A reverse-engineered, industrial-grade replica of the world's most popular cola.**

> **🛑 NOT "OPENCOLA"**: This is *not* a fork of the 2001 OpenCola™ recipe. OpenCola uses Gum Arabic for emulsification, resulting in a different texture. **Project 7X** utilizes the authentic **Alcohol-Cut Method** and **Tannin Structure** to replicate the crisp "bite" and dry finish of the commercial product known as Merchandise 7X.

## 🧪 The Science of "The Real Thing"
To achieve the distinct "Commercial Taste" rather than a "Homebrew Taste," this protocol enforces three industrial standards:

1.  **Ethanol Extraction:** We do not use gums to bind oils. We use 95% Grain Alcohol to "cut" the oils, allowing them to dissolve into the syrup invisibly.
2.  **Sugar Inversion:** We heat the sucrose to $80^\circ C$ with acid. This splits the sugar molecules (inversion), preventing crystallization and mimicking the sweetness curve of High Fructose Corn Syrup (or the original cane sugar version).
3.  **Tannin Replication:** The original formula used "spent coca leaves" (leaves with cocaine removed). These leaves added bitterness and astringency (dryness). We replicate this strictly using **Wine Tannins** or specific tea extracts.

## 📋 The Formula (10L Yield)

### Part A: The "7X" Flavor Core (The Secret)
*Mix this separately. This is your "Concentrate".*

| Component | Quantity | Role | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alcohol (95%)** | 120 ml | Solvent | Vodka is too weak. Everclear/Grain Alcohol only. |
| **Orange Oil** | 4.00 ml | Top Note | Cold Pressed |
| **Lemon Oil** | 1.00 ml | Top Note | |
| **Nutmeg Oil** | 0.35 ml | Body | The "Spicy" middle note |
| **Cassia Oil** | 0.35 ml | Body | **Critical:** Do NOT use standard Cinnamon |
| **Coriander Oil** | 0.15 ml | Floral | |
| **Neroli Oil** | 0.15 ml | Floral | The most expensive/important ingredient |
| **Lime Oil** | 0.60 ml | Sour | |
| **Lavender Oil** | 0.05 ml | Herbal | Trace amount for complexity |

### Part B: The Syrup Base

| Component | Quantity | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Filtered Water** | 4.0 Liters | Solvent |
| **Sugar (Sucrose)** | 9.0 kg | Sweetener |
| **Phosphoric Acid (85%)** | 65.0 g | Acidulant (The "Burn") |
| **Caffeine** | 6.0 g | Stimulant |
| **Caramel Color (Class IV)** | 135.0 g | Dark Black Color |
| **Glycerin** | 20.0 g | Mouthfeel |
| **Wine Tannin** | 2.5 g | Astringency / Leaf Replica |
| **Vanilla Extract** | 15.0 ml | Smoothness |

## ⚙️ Manufacturing Instructions

### Phase 1: The "Cut" (Day 1)
1.  Combine all **Part A** oils into a glass beaker.
2.  Add the oils to the **Alcohol**. Stir vigorously.
3.  **Critical:** Let this mixture stand for **24 hours**. You will see a "flocculent" (cloudy separation) occur. This is the "terpenes" separating. This is normal and authentic to the 1886 process.

### Phase 2: The Syrup (Day 2)
1.  Dissolve **Sugar** in **Water** and heat to $80^\circ C$. Maintain for 15 minutes to invert the sugar.
2.  Add **Phosphoric Acid**. (Safety Warning: Wear gloves).
3.  Add **Caffeine** and **Tannins** while hot. Stir until dissolved.
4.  Allow syrup to cool to room temperature.

### Phase 3: Final Assembly
1.  Pour the **Alcohol/Oil Mix (Part A)** into the cooled **Syrup (Part B)**.
2.  Add **Caramel Color**, **Glycerin**, and **Vanilla**.
3.  Mix thoroughly.

## 📦 Distribution & Serving
* **Dilution Ratio:** 1 Part Syrup to 5 Parts Carbonated Water.
* **Carbonation:** Target 3.5 - 4.0 Volumes of CO2 (High carbonation is key to the "Coke" burn).
